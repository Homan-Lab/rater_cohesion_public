# [Rater Cohesion and Quality from a Vicarious Perspective](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.296/)

Use script ``\src\run_voiced_experiments.py`` to run the experiments reported in the paper.  
This script saves the results locally and logs to weights and biases.  

We use the XRR implementation from <https://github.com/aneeta/xRR.git>.  
The implementation for the rest of the metrics can be found at ``\src\metrics\metrics.py``.
